# Bank Account Management System

A simple command-line banking system written in Python that allows users to:

- Create new bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Check account balance
- View full account details

This program demonstrates core concepts in Python including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **data validation**, and structured user interaction via a menu-driven system.

---

## Features

- Unique account ID generation using the user's name and CNIC
- CNIC validation (must be exactly 14 digits)
- Deposit and withdrawal functions with input checks
- Real-time account balance display
- Full account detail printing
- Menu-based interface with input validation

---

## How It Works

All accounts are stored in a global dictionary using unique account IDs. Each account is an instance of the `Bank` class. The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple actions (create account, deposit, withdraw, check balance, etc.) until they choose to exit.

## Getting Started

To run the program:

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder
3. Run the Python script using:
```bash
python bank_system.py
```

---

## Account ID Format

The account ID is generated by combining:

- First 3 letters of the account holder's name (lowercased)
- Digits 2–5 from the CNIC number

**Example:**  
Name: `Ali`  
CNIC: `12345678901234`  
Generated ID: `ali2345`

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## Educational Context

This project is not directly based on an O-Level or A-Level question. However, it demonstrates programming skills expected at an **A-Level (AS)** standard, including:

- Use of classes and objects
- Input validation
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- User interface design (text-based)

---

## Possible Extensions

- Add data persistence (save/load accounts using JSON or CSV)
- Password protection or login system
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt
- Account deletion or editing features
